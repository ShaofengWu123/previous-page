# Welcome!
##Introduction
This project aims to build a personal website based on Github Page. Also, it helps me in learning HTML, Markdown, CSS and Javascript.

## Modules
### Project Theme
The project theme is a revised version of one of the official Github Page theme-a Jekyll theme called Modernist theme. For its usage, please visit its [Github](https://github.com/pages-themes/modernist).
### particles.js
The website used a Javascript library called [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js). It is a light weight Javascript library that creates particle effect and can add some special flavor to your website.
